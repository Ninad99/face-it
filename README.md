# face-it
A small app that uses [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection-image-recognition-model-a403429f2ddf4b49b307e318f00e528b-detection#documentation) for face recognition.

This is the source code for the front-end. Source code for the back-end is [here](https://github.com/Ninad99/smartbrain-api).

This project was done quite a while back, when one had to pay for private repositories on Github😂.

Anyway I was still just starting out and didn't know the ins and outs of version control, and so pushed the build folder on the master branch for deployment🤦‍♂️. I've come a long way since then💪.

The code is still written in the old class-based component model (Hooks weren't introduced till v16.8).
